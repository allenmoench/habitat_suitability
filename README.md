# habitat_suitability

In this project I will analyze the effect of climactic changes on the habitat of Sorghastrum grass species. Changing climate may have caused changes to soil health, temperature, precipitation, or other factors that may be changing the traditional range of species distribution for Sorghastrum. I will create a reproducible workflow to analyze whether this is the case, and to provide a template that can be used to aks the same question for different species.
